They wanted to replicate that crunchy goodness we all love from fried food but without drowning it in oil. Using rapid hot air circulation (kinda like an oven on turbo mode), air fryers manage to give you that crispy magic with just a tiny drizzle of oil or none at all! The rest, as they say, is history. With more people looking to eat healthier, this little kitchen gadget exploded in popularity.'
